* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?): I really wanted to finish the coin sum problem with dynamic programming, but it was super hard to understand. Maybe it's just something I can't comprehend yet, I will have to go back and try again after learning more concepts.
* What is your goal for next week?: Learn structure of android code. I found animations that shake the input editText box if the input is not what it should be, but I don't know where to put the code.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can): android

### Think piece discussion (team leader has prepared answers and guides discussion)

* What are 2 things you took from this think piece?
  1. know your strengths and weaknesses
  2. weaknesses do not have to hold you back as long as you strive to work on getting better at it
* How does this think piece relate to access code?
  1. the take away message will help us when we start applying for jobs at the end of our access code journey
  2. we might feel like our weakness right now is not completely understanding everything about java or android, but as long as we put in the effort to keep learning, this weakness will not hold us back from achieving bigger goals.
