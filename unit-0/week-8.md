* Last week’s goal: learn dynamic programming
* What went well (what goals did you meet?): I was able to complete most of the bootcamp exercises
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?): I really wanted to finish the coin sum problem with dynamic programming, but it was super hard to understand. Maybe it's just something I can't comprehend yet, I will have to go back and try again after learning more concepts.
* What is your goal for next week?: Learn structure of android code. I found animations that shake the input editText box if the input is not what it should be, but I don't know where to put the code.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can): android
