**Sufei**

* Last week's medium post: [April Fools](https://medium.com/@sufeizhao/april-fools-65c77ba0864e)
* Last week’s goal: Complete old in class assignments that we didn't have time to complete.
* What went well (what goals did you meet?): Did not meat my goal; I attempted to do drawRocket again but I still don't quite get it. I was very proud of my calendar team for finishing or group project in a few hours, we were very productive that day.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?): Spend a long time on the Webpage Sanitizer homework assignment. My code works, but I saw a classmate was able to achieve the same results with just two lines of code. She used "regular expression", which I hope we can learn about soon.
* What is your goal for next week?: Spend more time reviewing my classmate's codes so I can see how many different ways there are to approach a problem.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can): drawRocket
