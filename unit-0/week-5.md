* Last week’s goal: Understand how and when to use the different types of collections ! 
* What went well (what goals did you meet?): I was able to become more famliar with using for each loops and the concept behind using them
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?): Learning how to create the specific code from scratch when creating programs
* What is your goal for next week?: To review old concepts that we have learned already and solify it more! 
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can): understanding when to use the different collection types!

**Jorge**

* Last week's medium post: https://medium.com/p/27fd1a04f91/edit
* Last week’s goal: Read in order for me to get a better understanding of the topics being taught in class.
* What went well (what goals did you meet?): I have been reading and I think the reading is helping me out
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?): I need more time to reading. I started realizong that the reading of Java books are really clearing things up. I wish I had more time for reading.
* What is your goal for next week?: My goal for next week is to catch up with my homework. 
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can): I need help putting my logic into code.

**Anna**

* Last week's medium post: Thinking about my APP.
* Last week’s goal: learn object, hashmap and arraylist. 
* What went well (what goals did you meet?): I know basic conception about object. 
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?): to use the object during coding.
* What is your goal for next week?: I wish I could catch up with others.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can): I need practise on how to combine method, object, and check API on line. 

**Sufei**

* Last week's medium post: [April Fools](https://medium.com/@sufeizhao/april-fools-65c77ba0864e)
* Last week’s goal: Complete old in class assignments that we didn't have time to complete.
* What went well (what goals did you meet?): Did not meat my goal; I attempted to do drawRocket again but I still don't quite get it. I was very proud of my calendar team for finishing or group project in a few hours, we were very productive that day.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?): Spend a long time on the Webpage Sanitizer homework assignment. My code works, but I saw a classmate was able to achieve the same results with just two lines of code. She used "regular expression", which I hope we can learn about soon.
* What is your goal for next week?: Spend more time reviewing my classmate's codes so I can see how many different ways there are to approach a problem.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can): drawRocket
