**Alvin**

* This week's medium post: https://medium.com/@ahhhlvin/motivation-perseverance-grit-61ecf14ab8b9
* Last week’s goal: completed my own adventure game and roman calculator! 
* What went well (what goals did you meet?): I was able to complete my projects and better understand the concepts that were used to build both my adventure game and the roman numeral calculator! :) 
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?): Understand concepts behind loops and methods 
* What is your goal for next week? To be able to create more complex projects! 
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) understanding nesting loops within loops

**Sufei**

* This week's medium post: [Self Reflection](https://medium.com/@sufeizhao/self-reflection-dd6bc2bf7629)
* Last week’s goal: Create a tip calculator
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) I didn't have time to even start on the tip calculator because we were working on the Roman calculator and our adventure game. But I am very proud of my team for finishing the Roman Calculator. Also, the TAs at office hours helped me create exceptions in my game.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) I wanted to improve my game by wrapping everything in a loop to allow the user to be able to restart if they die in the middle of the game, but I didn't have enough time to finish.
* What is your goal for next week? Make a tip calculator!
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) the drawrocket assignment
