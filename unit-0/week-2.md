* What went well (what goals did you meet?): I was able to complete my projects and better understand the concepts that were used to build both my adventure game and the roman numeral calculator! :) 
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?): Understand concepts behind loops and methods 
* What is your goal for next week? To be able to create more complex projects! 
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) understanding nesting loops within loops

**Sufei**

* This week's medium post: [Self Reflection](https://medium.com/@sufeizhao/self-reflection-dd6bc2bf7629)
* Last week’s goal: Create a tip calculator
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) I didn't have time to even start on the tip calculator because we were working on the Roman calculator and our adventure game. But I am very proud of my team for finishing the Roman Calculator. Also, the TAs at office hours helped me create exceptions in my game.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) I wanted to improve my game by wrapping everything in a loop to allow the user to be able to restart if they die in the middle of the game, but I didn't have enough time to finish.
* What is your goal for next week? Make a tip calculator!
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) the drawrocket assignment

**George Syrimis**

* This week's medium post: [medium](https://medium.com/@gmsyrimis/the-langoliers-6e0480bf88a9)
* Last week’s goal: Google API
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) Not much. This week went by, built as many things as I could. No APIs...
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?)
The game could have been better. I need to make measureable and predictable goals. And have alternatives if something is getting too big and pushing my deadline.
* What is your goal for next week? Fix my head, adjust.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) Turning off a while loop that's in my head. The condition is true and running continuesly. haha

* Last week’s goal:To create a complex program.
* What went well (what goals did you meet?)I met my goal of building a program which i am very happy about for homework.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?)Not much I got lots of help from a cousin who is majoring in Computer information system so he helped me a lot with my java skills.
* What is your goal for next week? Make sure everything is clear.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) I think I need help with putting my logic into code.
