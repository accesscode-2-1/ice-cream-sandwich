### Think piece discussion (team leader has prepared answers and guides discussion)

* What are 2 things you took from this think piece?
  1. Diversity within the tech sector is good! 
  2. One does not necessarily need a 4 year degree in computer science in order to become a developer.
* How does this think piece relate to access code?
  1.  It assures everyone that you don't have to fit the stereotype of what a "developer" is in order to be a successful and competent developer/engineer
  2. Access code and C4Q emphasizes and promotes diversity in all aspects of life in order to change the concept of what the tech community is "supposed" to look like.
