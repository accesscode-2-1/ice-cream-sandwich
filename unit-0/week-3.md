### Retrospective

**Alvin**

* Last week's medium post: [Medium](https://medium.com/@ahhhlvin/reflections-f483aa3dd958)
* Last week’s goal: Completed a few of the homework assignments without any help!!! :simple_smile:
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) I was able to figure out how to work out solutions on my own
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) I did get a bit confused because I would have the basic logic but would get stuck thinking in a way that wasn't the best solution, and then I would try and get a few tips 
* What is your goal for next week? To complete all of the homework assignments on my own! 
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) Changing my way of analyzing problems to produce solutions using code

**George**

* Last week's medium post:

**Jorge**

* To understand topics better.
* I had some very good help from som TAs but, unfortunately I didn't have a laptop for a couple of days so I am a little behind everyone else.
* Timing. I feel like I don't have enough time to practice and review.
* Practice, practice, practice... and catch up.
* What do you need help with? Methods

**Anna**

* Last week's medium post: [Medium](https://medium.com/@annalinewyork/have-to-learn-how-to-learn-e1cf6812d670)
* Last week’s goal: Last week I learned the expanding string, object, my goal is to understand it and try to use them with the loops. 
* What went well (what goals did you meet?): I can write some simple method.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?): I am learning API right now, I think if I know how to use it, it will help me a lot. 
* What is your goal for next week?: I am still try to learn those expanding string, combine with method, I know them when TA explain to me, but once I face a new exercise, I can't do it. 
* What do you need help with?: (peers sign up to help if they can) TA helps a lot. I sometimes feels I have some solutions but just can not catch it... I need more exercise. 

**Sufei**

* Last week's medium post: [IntelliJ and I](https://medium.com/@sufeizhao/the-red-squiggly-of-death-938285277b9)
* Last week’s goal: Create tip calculator
* What went well (what goals did you meet?): Was able to catch up on unfinished exercises. Completed hw assignments and finally started on Tip Calculator
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?): I wasn't happy with my Verbosity Calculator code. I wanted to not count 'III.' or 'V.' as a sentence, but didn't have time.
* What is your goal for next week?: Finish tip calculator and start on Half Birthday Calculator
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can): Learn to comment better on my codes

### Think piece discussion (team leader has prepared answers and guides discussion)

* What are 2 things you took from this think piece?
  1. The author had a lot of grit, which is why he was able to complete his project in such a short amount of time.
  2. We experience the same circle of learning everyday in class.
* How does this think piece relate to access code?
  1. He set out to accomplish something and kept at it until it was done, even when it was hard in the beginning. We should have the same attitude during our access code journey.
  2. Once we master java, it's possible for us to venture into other languages if we wanted to.

### TODOs

### Extra comments / Anything you want your program managers to know

### Next Week
