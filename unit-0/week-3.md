### Retrospective

Alvin

* Last week's medium post: [Medium](https://medium.com/@ahhhlvin/reflections-f483aa3dd958)
* Last week’s goal: Completed a few of the homework assignments without any help!!! :simple_smile:
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) I was able to figure out how to work out solutions on my own
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) I did get a bit confused because I would have the basic logic but would get stuck thinking in a way that wasn't the best solution, and then I would try and get a few tips 
* What is your goal for next week? To complete all of the homework assignments on my own! 
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) Changing my way of analyzing problems to produce solutions using code

Jorge

* To understand topics better.
* I had some very good help from som TAs but, unfortunately I didn't have a laptop for a couple of days so I am a little behind everyone else.
* Timing. I feel like I don't have enough time to practice and review.
* Practice, practice, practice... and catch up.

Anna

* Last week’s goal: Last week I learned the expanding string, object, my goal is to understand it and try to use them with the loops. 
* What went well (what goals did you meet?): I can write some simple method.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?): I am learning API right now, I think if I know how to use it, it will help me a lot. 
* What is your goal for next week?: I am still try to learn those expanding string, combine with method, I know them when TA explain to me, but once I face a new exercise, I can't do it. 
* What do you need help with?: (peers sign up to help if they can) TA helps a lot. I sometimes feels I have some solutions but just can not catch it... I need more exercise.
