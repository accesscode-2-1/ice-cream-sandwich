* Last week’s goal: Get a better understanding of git and github
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) I feel a lot more confident about git. I completely understood all the clases.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?)I feel I need a little bit of more practice with git hub. Still find myself confused at times.
* What is your goal for next week? I am really anxious about creating a more complex program. Hopefully I get to do one with what we learn during the next week.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can)Still a bit confused with github. I'll try to find some time to come to office hours and get a better understanding of it.
